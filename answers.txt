Q: Q: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A: Merge allows you to merge branches together and allow the logs of the commits on branches to stay intact.
Rebase allows you to integrate changes from one branch to another and the logs are modified after that is done.
Merge creates a new commit that has two parent commits.
Rebase replays the commits from the feature branch on top of the master branch to create a linear commit history and prevent merge conflicts.

Q: What is a remote repository?

A: A remote repository is a version of your repository that is stored on a remote server. This is usually in a shared location that allows
other contributors to share the data and makes changes to it collectively.
